after typing something on the search textbox, you should be able to press enter to get search result
spinner is always running. should be displayed at the time of data loading
If you search for 'iphone', check the api, you should get a lot of data but the UI displays only one phone
Search is not clearing previous results
picture of the phones are not showing
Show All button should be hidden after all data is loaded
Load phone details doesn't display anything
Phone details are added on the modal but this is not getting displayed. why?
